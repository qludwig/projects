Contained within: bootcamp assignments of which I'm particularly proud

DVDLibrary and Vending Machine are both Spring MVC web apps. 

In DVDLibrary, the user can perform basic CRUD operations, stored to a database, and search the library by Title, Release Date, Rating, Director, and Studio.

In Vending Machine, like a real vending machine, the user cannot add items, but the page content is dynamic and loads the items from a database. Although the money handling could have been done in JavaScript, I implemented it server side for practice, but the Money object is stored in memory only. I am working on creating an admin mode - for the machine technician to add and alter products.
